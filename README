An utility to find low and high fenches from rrd information that can be
used in monitoring as lower and upper limits for alarming.

$ rrdtool dump file.rrd |
> xmllint --xpath /rrd/rra/database/row/v |
> sed 's/<v>//g; s/<\/v>/\n/g' |
> outlier
lof: -105.000000 q1: 155.000000 m: 305.000000 q3: 415.000000 hof: 675.000000 (range: 260.000000)

lof   = low fench (q1 - range)
q1    = first quartile
m     = mean
q3    = third quartile
hof   = high fench (q3 + range)
range = q3 - q1

The numbers above are just a random sample data.
