An utility to find low and high fenches from rrd information that can be
used in monitoring as lower and upper limits for alarming.

$ echo "71 70 73 70 70 69 70 72 71 300 71 69" |
> outlier -w 3
lof: 65.500000 q1: 70.000000 m: 70.500000 q3: 71.500000 hif: 76.000000 (range: 4.500000)

$ rrdtool dump sample.rrd |
> outlier --rrdxml
lof: -105.000000 q1: 155.000000 m: 305.000000 q3: 415.000000 hif: 675.000000 (range: 260.000000)

lof   = low fench (q1 - range)
q1    = first quartile
m     = mean
q3    = third quartile
hif   = high fench (q3 + range)
range = q3 - q1

The numbers above are just a random sample data.
